## Unreleased

### Changed

- Forked from ClosedXML.Parser 2.0.0 and published as `XLibur.ClosedXML.Parser`. The
  `ClosedXML.Parser` namespace is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Parse a quoted sheet prefix in the Pratt parser. `QIdent` was lexed but no prefix
  parselet was registered for it, so every quoted sheet reference failed — `'New York'!A1`
  and `'Jane''s'!A1` as much as anything else a serializer quotes. The new parselet strips
  the apostrophes, collapses the doubled ones, and handles `'sheet'!A1`, `'sheet'!name` and
  `'first:last'!A1`. External workbook prefixes stay unsupported, as they are on the
  unquoted path.
- Quote sheet names the way Excel's file format requires, not the way its formula bar
  displays them. The quotation tables were collected from the formula bar, which is more
  permissive than the file format: Excel shows `ABC～!A1` for a sheet named `ABC～`
  (U+FF5E) but stores `'ABC～'!A1`. For 41 codepoints in the first position and 37 in a
  later one the tables said no quotes were needed when Excel quotes. For some of those
  Excel refuses to open a workbook that references them unquoted, and which ones depends
  on the position: U+2028, U+2029, U+202A–U+202E, U+303D and U+303E as the first
  character, U+2065–U+2069 and U+303D anywhere. The tables were re-collected from saved
  workbooks across the whole BMP; see `tools/sheet-quotation`. Upstream issue
  [ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser#29](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser/issues/29).
- Quote a sheet named `TRUE` or `FALSE`, in any casing. Every character is unremarkable
  on its own, so only the whole name gives it away; unquoted, Excel reads `TRUE!A1` as a
  logical literal and refuses to open the file.
- Escape apostrophes in a sheet name relative to where the name was appended.
  `NameUtils.EscapeName` replaced from a hardcoded index 1, which is only correct when
  the `StringBuilder` is empty. Every caller happens to pass an empty builder, so no
  output was wrong, but the helper mangled the formula for any that did not.
- Write formula numbers with the invariant culture. `ToR1C1` used the current culture's
  negative sign, so under sv-SE, fi-FI or nb-NO (negative sign U+2212) it emitted
  `RC[−1]`, which the R1C1 reader could not parse back. Upstream issue
  [ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser#30](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser/issues/30).
- Parse a keyword list that is a whole inner reference.
