# Changelog

All notable changes to XLibur.ClosedXML.Parser are recorded here. The Publish Release
workflow rolls the Unreleased section into a dated version heading, so add an entry
under Unreleased with each change.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `ReferenceParser.TryParseR1C1`. Every public method of `ReferenceParser` lexed with the
  A1 table, so a caller holding an R1C1 reference had no entry point at all, and the
  library's own tests had to reach through `InternalsVisibleTo` to parse one. The
  reference is read as written: a relative axis keeps its offset and is not resolved
  against an anchor cell, so `R[-1]C` gives a relative row of -1 and a relative column of
  0. The other five public methods keep their A1-only form.

### Changed

- Forked from ClosedXML.Parser 2.0.0 and published as `XLibur.ClosedXML.Parser`. The
  `ClosedXML.Parser` namespace is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Treat malformed UTF-16 as invalid input instead of throwing out of the lexer. A trailing
  high surrogate read past the end of the input: the bounds check was `index >=
  input.Length`, which can never be true, because the caller only calls into the reader
  while `index < input.Length` — it should have been `index + 1`. Text ending in a lone
  high surrogate therefore threw `IndexOutOfRangeException`, and a high surrogate followed
  by anything other than a low surrogate threw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` from
  `char.ConvertToUtf32`. A surrogate is now only combined when a low surrogate actually
  follows it; anything else is lexed as an error token, so `TryParseA1` and `TryParseR1C1`
  return `false` rather than throwing. Paired surrogates are unaffected.
- Reject a written R1C1 axis number of zero. `C0` parsed as if it were `C`, so
  `TryParseR1C1("C0")` returned `true` and `ToA1("C0")` quietly produced `C:C`. Rows and
  columns are numbered from 1; only a missing number (`R`, `C`) and a bracketed zero
  (`R[0]`, `C[0]`) mean an axis relative to the current cell. The axis reader could not
  tell an absent number from a written `0`, because both left its accumulator at zero.
  Only columns were affected — the grammar admits a bare zero for a column but not for a
  row, so `R0` and `R0C0` were already refused. The grammar still admits `C0` and the
  reader now rejects it; regenerating the R1C1 DFA without the literal zero would be the
  tidier fix, but the Rolex generator is not in the repository.
- Read the called cell of a cell function in the formula's reference style.
  `TokenParser.ExtractCellFunction` always read it as A1, so in R1C1 mode `R7C3(TRUE)` was
  read as the A1 cell `R7` and the `C3` was thrown away. It failed silently, because what
  it produced still looked like a plausible reference. `FormulaConverterToA1Tests` carried
  the case as `Skip = "Parser bug"`, and its expectation was wrong as well — `R7C3` is
  absolute row 7 and absolute column 3, so it converts to `$C$7`, not `$E$11`. The
  reference style is now an adapter taken once beside the DFA table it belongs with, so
  the table and the reader cannot disagree and there is no longer a style flag that can be
  passed incorrectly.
- Parse a quoted sheet prefix in the Pratt parser. `QIdent` was lexed but no prefix
  parselet was registered for it, so every quoted sheet reference failed — `'New York'!A1`
  and `'Jane''s'!A1` as much as anything else a serializer quotes. The new parselet strips
  the apostrophes, collapses the doubled ones, and handles `'sheet'!A1`, `'sheet'!name` and
  `'first:last'!A1`. External workbook prefixes stay unsupported, as they are on the
  unquoted path.
- Quote sheet names the way Excel's file format requires, not the way its formula bar
  displays them. The quotation tables were collected from the formula bar, which is more
  permissive than the file format: Excel shows `ABC～!A1` for a sheet named `ABC～`
  (U+FF5E) but stores `'ABC～'!A1`. For 41 codepoints in the first position and 37 in a
  later one the tables said no quotes were needed when Excel quotes. For some of those
  Excel refuses to open a workbook that references them unquoted, and which ones depends
  on the position: U+2028, U+2029, U+202A–U+202E, U+303D and U+303E as the first
  character, U+2065–U+2069 and U+303D anywhere. The tables were re-collected from saved
  workbooks across the whole BMP; see `tools/sheet-quotation`. Upstream issue
  [ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser#29](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser/issues/29).
- Quote a sheet named `TRUE` or `FALSE`, in any casing. Every character is unremarkable
  on its own, so only the whole name gives it away; unquoted, Excel reads `TRUE!A1` as a
  logical literal and refuses to open the file.
- Escape apostrophes in a sheet name relative to where the name was appended.
  `NameUtils.EscapeName` replaced from a hardcoded index 1, which is only correct when
  the `StringBuilder` is empty. Every caller happens to pass an empty builder, so no
  output was wrong, but the helper mangled the formula for any that did not.
- Write formula numbers with the invariant culture. `ToR1C1` used the current culture's
  negative sign, so under sv-SE, fi-FI or nb-NO (negative sign U+2212) it emitted
  `RC[−1]`, which the R1C1 reader could not parse back. Upstream issue
  [ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser#30](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser/issues/30).
- Parse a keyword list that is a whole inner reference.
